# Global PIQA v0.1

<b>Global PIQA</b> is a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335 researchers from 65 countries around the world.
The 116 language varieties in Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing systems.
In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific elements.
Details are in our preprint: [Global PIQA: Evaluating Physical Commonsense Reasoning Across 100+ Languages and Cultures (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24081).

Following the English PIQA dataset ([Bisk et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11641)), each example consists of a prompt and two candidate solutions, one correct and one incorrect.
Determining the correct solution is designed to require physical commonsense reasoning, although we allow for fairly flexible definitions of physical commonsense (e.g. knowledge of physical properties of objects, affordances, physical and temporal relations, and everyday activities).
Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language is embedded.

<b>Get involved!</b> For Global PIQA v1, we plan to expand the language coverage of Global PIQA and add a parallel split of the dataset. If you speak a language currently not represented in Global PIQA, please fill out the interest form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc73SSB2Med_SEpsSvOEcw50g3Y1kkK6od8ZfRlL0162vi3lw/viewform?usp=header)!
